Having a rough day? Could use some kind words to lift Your spirit? And there is a lock down in effect so You can't go out to meet Your friends? 

The Feel Good app is exactly for days like that. Not only for those who like to look back on some nice words from time to time.

# Extended bio

My name is Szymon, but You can call me Simon if You like. After having multiple jobs first in physical labor and later on a couple of office jobs, I've started my own business in March 2019, although it was a startup for a couple of months before that. I wanted to work for myself and be artistically active. So I've opened a shop with hand-dyed yarn known as Slavica Yarns. 

Somewhere down the road, I got annoyed by my current online shop provider, so I've decided to learn to program and create my own. I was already using basic HTML and CSS to style the various pages in my shop, so how hard could it be? I admit, I've bitten off more than I could chew, learning to be a full-stack developer in a year was madness. 

Even Though I was doomed to fail in creating my own online shop in a year, I've been bitten by the programming bug (pun intended ;P) and what was supposed to be a means to an end became my hobby of sorts. I was fascinated by what my mentor (a full-stack React developer) could do, how fast and easy it is for him to create all sorts of functionalities and logic. I know I have a long way to go, but that is what I would like to achieve. One day I would like to be able to sit down and write a whole web page or app from A to Z. I especially like writing logic, styling ain't much my thing, but figuring out the proper combination of functions, calling other functions, influencing multiple states at the same time to create the required result is my jam. Not that I'm much better at it than styling though. 

Hope You'll enjoy what You find in this repository. 

Have a nice day!
